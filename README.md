## Hello, I'm Lamberto Martinez‼️👋🏼

### About Me 🧍🏻

<p>Hello my name is Lamberto Martinez, and I'm a Software Engineer highly skilled in JavaScript (ES5/ES6), React JS, HTML 5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, and many more! I love being able to bring my code to to life and seeing my friends and family put it to use. As technology advances I make sure to stay ontop of it and do my research which allows me to tay up to date and apply it to my current code!</p>
